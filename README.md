ðŸŒ±ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project: Plant Disease Classification Using AI! ðŸš€ðŸŒ±

I am thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project, where we harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to develop a robust plant disease classification system.

Farmers every year face significant economic losses and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. To address this, we have developed an innovative solution using image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our Website allows farmers to take a picture of their potato plants, and the app will instantly identify if the plant has a disease or not.

ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights:
Model Building: Utilized TensorFlow, CNN, data augmentation, and Kaggle Datasets to create a robust and accurate model.

Backend Server and ML Ops: Implemented using TensorFlow Serving and FastAPI to ensure seamless integration and scalability.

Model Optimization: Applied techniques like quantization and TensorFlow Lite to optimize the model for mobile deployment.

Frontend Development: Designed a user-friendly interface with React JS for an intuitive and accessible experience.
